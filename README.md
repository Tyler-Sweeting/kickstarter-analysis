# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to present information to an up-and-coming playwright who wants to use a crowdfuding campaign to fund her play. We will use several forms of data analytics to present charts and graphs that will better prepare the playwright to ensure a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Two outcomes that can be concluded from the outcomes based on launch date are that campaigns which are started in May and June are far more likely to succeed than they are to fail. Also, campaigns that are launched in December have a near equal chance at success or failure. 

- A conclusion to be made on outcomes based on goals is that campaigns with a funding goal of $5000 or less are far more likely to be successful than they are to fail. As the goal gets higher, specifically over $10,000, it becomes less certain that the campaign will be successful. 

- Some limitations of this dataset are a handful of outliers where the goal for the campaign is excessively high and the pledged amount is negligible.

- Another possible table to create would be one that shows Outcomes based on location of the campaign.
